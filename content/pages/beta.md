## New shiny things to test!

**Beta 5**

* New walkie talkie automatic generation tool
* Added a ton of new voice lines and triggers for the walkie talkie buddy
* Added new stats on how many times a voice line has been activated that are persisted on disk
* Now the game reads the new stats to make voice lines to be less frequent as they've been presented before several times.
* Added new hint system that goes along with the walkie talkie buddy
* New focus vignette and indicator for Ghost and Breach to give visual aid to the player to find them.

**Beta 4**

* New Campaign mode
* Player leveling up by gaining Score (EXP)
* Unlock maps as you progress
* Money system. Earn money and risk losing it when you die.
* Grades and Badges for completing missions. Do it really well, get an A. Do it badly, get an F.
* Reworked the old "New Game" menu into Custom Mission, simplified and more elegant.
