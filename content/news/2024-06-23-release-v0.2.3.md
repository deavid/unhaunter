**Features:**

* **New Consumable Items:**
    * Salt: You can drop salt on the ground, and if the ghost walks over it, 
      it will leave a trace of salt where it goes. These traces are only visible 
      under UV light.
    * Quartz Stone: It absorbs the ghost's hunting energy, effectively shortening 
      hunts and protecting the player. The stone gradually cracks and eventually 
      breaks after repeated uses.
    * Sage: Burn it and smoke the ghost, and it will calm it down for 30 seconds.
      During hunts, it will confuse the ghost and make it lose track of the player. 
* **New Menu: Map Hub:**
    * Provides a clear and dedicated menu for selecting the map and difficulty 
      level before starting a new game.
    * Displays all available maps in a list, allowing for easy browsing and selection.
    * Presents a separate screen for choosing from a range of 16 difficulty levels, 
      each with a description of its unique challenges.
* **Expanded Difficulty System:**
    * Offers 16 distinct difficulty levels, ranging from "Novice Investigator" 
      to "Master Guardian", providing a wide range of challenges for players 
      of all skill levels.
    * Each difficulty level affects various aspects of the game, including 
      ghost behavior, environment conditions, player attributes, and scoring.
    * Difficulties now customize the available equipment for the player.
* **Improved Ghost Expulsion Feedback:**
    * When a ghost is successfully expelled, it now fades out over 5 seconds 
      while emitting smoke particles, creating a more noticeable and satisfying
      visual effect.
    * The ghost's breach also fades out, indicating its permanent 
      departure from the location.
    * Two distinct roar sounds now play during the expulsion, adding to the
      dramatic effect.

**Fixes:**

* **Lighting:** Several adjustments have been made to the lighting system to 
  create a more visually appealing and atmospheric environment.
* **Quartz Stone:** The Quartz Stone's energy absorption rate is now adjusted
  based on the selected difficulty level, making it more effective at higher difficulty levels.
* **Repellent Flask:** The behavior of the Repellent Flask particles has been
  improved. They now spread more realistically, preventing them from clumping 
  together or moving in an unnatural way.
* **Hiding Mechanics:**
    * Players can no longer hide while carrying any items, 
      preventing conflicts with other actions.
    * The player's sprite now changes color when hiding, 
      providing a visual indicator of their hidden state.
    * Hiding now requires the player to hold down the "E" key 
      for a short duration, reducing accidental triggers.
* **Truck Journal:** The Truck Journal UI now filters possible evidence more
  effectively based on the selected ghost type, streamlining the evidence selection process.
