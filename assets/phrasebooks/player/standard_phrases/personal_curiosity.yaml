# Personal: Curiosity 

- I'm curious about you. 
- I want to know more about your story.
- What's it like being a ghost? 
- Do you remember what it was like to be alive? 
- Is there anything you want to tell us?
- Do you have any messages for the living? 
- We're here to listen. 
- We're not here to judge you. 
- We want to understand.
