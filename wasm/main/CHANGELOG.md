  via walkie-talkie, primarily aimed at assisting players on easier difficulties. #94
    *   Includes UI text display accompanying the audio messages.
    *   Provides contextual messages for events like:
        *   starting a mission
        *   forgetting gear
        *   pre-hunt warnings
    *   Added more message variety and tuned activation conditions.
*   **Hold-to-Activate Truck Buttons :** Implemented a hold duration requirement for critical
  truck UI buttons (Craft Repellent, End Mission) to prevent accidental activation.
  Includes visual progress bar and audio feedback during the hold. #32
*   **Auto-Hiding Mouse Cursor:** The mouse cursor now automatically hides after a short
  period of inactivity during gameplay, enhancing immersion. #74
*   **Basic Spatial Audio:** Implemented initial spatial audio (volume-based positioning) 
  for sound effects, providing better directional awareness. #54
*   **Look at left hand:** `Left Control` now allows to focus and see the left hand gear,
  and set the evidence on the left hand. #27

*   **Music volume:** Increased music volume, which allows for a very loud music at 100%. #92
*   **Snappier Camera:** Adjusted for a faster, snappier feel and improved responsiveness. #93
*   **WASM now allows for resizing:** Improved WASM CSS handling so in-browser gaming uses the full browser window. #63

### Version 0.2.6 - 2025-03-09

**Features:**

*   **Miasma System:** Introduced a dynamic miasma (fog) system that affects gameplay.
    The miasma's density and movement are simulated, and it interacts with the environment and player.
*   **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI):** Added a new mechanic where the ghost,
    particularly during its pre-hunt warning phase, emits electromagnetic interference.
    This affects electronic gear (Flashlight, EMF Meter, Recorder, Red Torch, Videocam), 
    causing glitches, malfunctions, and false readings. This adds a layer of challenge 
    and realism to using electronic equipment.
*   **Stamina System Integration:** The miasma now directly impacts the player's stamina.
    Higher miasma density in a location increases the rate at which stamina depletes while sprinting.
    This encourages players to avoid or quickly traverse miasma-filled areas.

**Changes:**

*   **Lighting System Refactoring:**
    * The lighting system has been significantly refactored for improved performance and organization.
    * Light propagation now uses a pre-baked data structure along with wave edges, allowing for dynamic light calculation with closed doors and windows.
    * The van's light is sampled by an offset to avoid darkening.

*   **Ghost Behavior:**
    * Ghost rage mechanics were refined, now considering player presence in the location overall.
    * Added a pre-hunt warning state for the ghost, including visual and auditory cues.

*   **Difficulty Adjustments:**
    * Updated hunt provocation radius values across different difficulty levels to improve game balance.

*   **Gear Adjustments:**
    * Added Electromagnetic interference to electronic gear.


### Version 0.2.5 - 2025-02-08

**Features:**

*   **Screenspace orthogonal movement**: Now players can choose to move the 
    character relative to the screen or relative to the map.
*   **Settings**: Added gameplay + audio settings which are saved to disk or 
    local storage for WASM.

**Changes:**

*   Bumped Bevy version to 0.15

**Other:**

*   Migrated core features and systems to separate crates for better organization and maintainability.

### Version 0.2.4 - 2024-12-30

**Features:**

* **Manual with 5 chapters!**
  * Created a whole manual with 5 chapters to ease in new people into the game.
  * Each chapter is linked to a difficulty to help people read the critical things on the game.
* **Ghost Rage adjusted:**
    * Ghosts now get angrier with more aggressive actions.
    * Ghost hunting duration is no longer increased by the anger.
    * A new cool-down logic for hunting has been implemented on top of the ghost rage.
        
**Changes:**

* **Gear:**
  * Added support to use different gears in the truck depending on the chosen difficulty.

  * Tiled 0.12

**Fixes:**

* Code has been cleaned and commented, improving overall quality.

### Version 0.2.3 - 2024-06-23

**Features:**

* **New Consumable Items:**
    * Salt: You can drop salt on the ground, and if the ghost walks over it, 
      it will leave a trace of salt where it goes. These traces are only visible 
      under UV light.
    * Quartz Stone: It absorbs the ghost's hunting energy, effectively shortening 
      hunts and protecting the player. The stone gradually cracks and eventually 
      breaks after repeated uses.
    * Sage: Burn it and smoke the ghost, and it will calm it down for 30 seconds.
      During hunts, it will confuse the ghost and make it lose track of the player. 
* **New Menu: Map Hub:**
    * Provides a clear and dedicated menu for selecting the map and difficulty 
      level before starting a new game.
    * Displays all available maps in a list, allowing for easy browsing and selection.
    * Presents a separate screen for choosing from a range of 16 difficulty levels, 
      each with a description of its unique challenges.
* **Expanded Difficulty System:**
    * Offers 16 distinct difficulty levels, ranging from "Novice Investigator" 
      to "Master Guardian", providing a wide range of challenges for players 
      of all skill levels.
    * Each difficulty level affects various aspects of the game, including 
      ghost behavior, environment conditions, player attributes, and scoring.
    * Difficulties now customize the available equipment for the player.
* **Improved Ghost Expulsion Feedback:**
    * When a ghost is successfully expelled, it now fades out over 5 seconds 
      while emitting smoke particles, creating a more noticeable and satisfying
      visual effect.
    * The ghost's breach also fades out, indicating its permanent 
      departure from the location.
    * Two distinct roar sounds now play during the expulsion, adding to the
      dramatic effect.

**Fixes:**

* **Lighting:** Several adjustments have been made to the lighting system to 
  create a more visually appealing and atmospheric environment.
* **Quartz Stone:** The Quartz Stone's energy absorption rate is now adjusted
  based on the selected difficulty level, making it more effective at higher difficulty levels.
* **Repellent Flask:** The behavior of the Repellent Flask particles has been
  improved. They now spread more realistically, preventing them from clumping 
  together or moving in an unnatural way.
* **Hiding Mechanics:**
    * Players can no longer hide while carrying any items, 
      preventing conflicts with other actions.
    * The player's sprite now changes color when hiding, 
      providing a visual indicator of their hidden state.
    * Hiding now requires the player to hold down the "E" key 
      for a short duration, reducing accidental triggers.
* **Truck Journal:** The Truck Journal UI now filters possible evidence more
  effectively based on the selected ghost type, streamlining the evidence selection process.
* **Windows:** Fixed a bug that prevented map tileset images from loading correctly 
  in the Windows build, ensuring compatibility and a consistent experience across platforms.
* **General:**
    * Addressed several warnings and clippy lints to improve 
      code quality and maintainability.
    * Fixed minor UI issues and typos in the game.

### Version 0.2.2 - 2024-06-02

**Features:**

* **Item Grab & Drop:** 
    * Items are now dropped to the center of the tile and it
      checks for other items to prevent dropping items in occupied tiles.
* **Deployable Gear:**
    * Players can now press `G` to drop the gear to the ground.
    * `F` will pick up the gear if there's space for it.
    * Gear continues to work while on the ground
* **New Sound effects:**
    * The ghost will snore, roar and more on different scenarios.
    * The player will hear a loud heardbeat when the health is low.
    * The backgroud music will fade out and be replaced by unsettling sounds
      when the sanity is low. 
* **Basic Spatial sound:**
    * Now the sounds will have a volume (not panning) depending on the distance.
    
**Fixes:**
  * Increased overall brightness of the game.
  * Ensure the torch iluminates the player itself.

### Version 0.2.1 - 2024-05-26

**Features:**

* **Ghost Events:**
    * The ghost can now slam a door closed.
    * The ghost can also flicker lightly the lights of the room.
* **Hiding Mechanics:**
    * Player can now press `E` near tables, beds, and other objects to hide itself.
    * The ghost will be confused when hunting for the player.
    * The player will need to press `E` again to be able to move.
* **Grab & Drop Items:**
    * Players can now pick up light items with `F`
    * While carrying an item they're slower, they can drop the item with `G`
* **Object-Ghost Interaction System:** 
    * Introduced a new system that allows players to influence the ghost's 
      behavior by manipulating objects in the environment.
    * Objects are assigned hidden properties (`Attractive`, `Repulsive`) that
      affect how the ghost interacts with them.
    * The ghost's roaming behavior is now influenced by the proximity
      and charge levels of objects.
    * Players can provoke hunts by placing `Repulsive` objects near 
      the ghost's breach and by removing `Attractive` objects from the location.
    * Added visual glow effects to objects based on their properties
      and the active light source, revealing their influence on the ghost.

**Maps:**

* **Updated University map:**
    * As we now depend on having objects, it was time to get an update to the
      big university map to add all sorts of objects. It looks pretty cool!
* **New Tutorial: Glass House:**
    * A simple map where all walls are transparent so that it is easy to see, 
      and players can learn the ghost evidences at their own pace.

**Fixes:**

* **Lighting:** Improved lighting system and see in the dark.
* **Reduced difficulty:** With the new object interaction system it was becoming
  much more difficult as there's more need to explore, so sanity loss and ghost rage
  was reduced. Temperatures now update in a more aggressive way to simplify tracking
  the ghost as it now roams much more.

**Tools:**

* **Ghost Radio Tool:**  Added a console-based demo tool for testing and
  experimenting with simplified ghost communication.
