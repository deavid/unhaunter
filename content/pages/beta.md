## New shiny things to test!

### Beta 1

**Mouse Aiming**

* Now you can hover with the mouse around and the flashlight will follow.
* Flashlight visual enhanced for long range scan.
* Clicking now will make the character walk towards the cursor.
* Clicking nearby something activable/interactive, will also interact with it, as if it were the [E] key.
* Right click will enable/disable right hand equipment, like the [R] key.
* Scrollwheel on the mouse will cycle through inventory like [Q].
* Walking around with mouse has pathfinding and indicators for waypoints. Works on stairs too.

**Journal UI**

* Discard evidence hidden away, now the user has to Shift+Click.
* Simpler, better Ghost filtering logic.
* If only one ghost is possible, it auto-selects. If the ghost selected is no longer possible, it de-selects.
* Improved UI element visibility with adjusted border thickness and padding.
* Implemented repellent crafting limits and refund system based on difficulty level.
* Player automatically exits truck after crafting repellent.
* Added GrayMan to TmpEMFUVOrbs ghost set - now we have 6 ghosts for missions 4, 5 and 6.

**Gameplay Improvements:**

* Miasma can now spread through half-walls and other see-through obstacles.
* Temperature spreads more realistically through walls and obstacles, including through stairs.
* Repellent particles now change color upon hitting ghosts (electric blue for correct, bright red for incorrect).
* Smart hint system provides feedback for incorrect repellent usage.
* Adjusted Temps/Geiger to be easier and more reliable to get.

**Walkie-Talkie System:**

* Ghost hunt warnings are now only triggered if the player is inside the location and the ghost is sufficiently healthy.
* Walkie-talkie hints for player sanity and wellbeing are now more sensitive and frequent.
* Increased repeat frequency for hints about crafting repellents when enough evidence is gathered.
* Walkie event priority is reduced if messages have been played before to avoid repetition.
* Adjusted timing and delays for better hint delivery.

**UI/UX Enhancements:**

* Increased visible duration for hint UI messages.
* Better camera reference point for improved player centering.
* Adjusted flashlight lighting effect.

**Other:**

* Bevy upgraded to version 0.16
* Complete overhaul of the `ghost_list` CLI tool.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed error on negative miasma pressure that got NaN into player position and direction, making the game randomly unplayable.
* Fix for random crash when expelling an entity (sound file format error)
* Fix collision bug when a door is closed on top of the player.
* WASM: Prevent accidental closing of the tab via Ctrl+W.
* Fixed bug where ghost guess auto-selection wasn't always working properly.
* Fixed ghost guess resource to use difficulty-specific ghost sets.
* Fixed log spam when music volume setting was zero.
