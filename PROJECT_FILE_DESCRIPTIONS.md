This is an inex of all files in the project for reference. So if we need to know where's something, this should be enough
to guide us on where to look it.

In this guide we talk about an hypothetic "Feature X": This refers to, if we wanted to add a new feature that modifies that
file, what it could be. This gives ideas when finding what files are relevant for modification when we need to do something.
It doesn't exist, and it's just for example purposes.

This file is meant for AI Coding assistants, specially those integrated with the editor such as "GitHub Copilot" or
"Gemini Code Assist" so they can see the whole project structure.


**General Project Files**

*   `.cargo/config.toml`:
    *   **Purpose:** Configuration file for Cargo (Rust's build system and package manager).  Specifically, this file sets target-specific compiler flags and linker options.
    *   **Interactions:**  Interacts directly with the Rust compiler and linker.
    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Would likely be touched if we needed to:
        *   Change compilation targets (e.g., add support for a new architecture).
        *   Optimize for specific CPU features.
        *   Change linker options (e.g., use a different linker for faster builds).
        *   Add or modify compilation flags.
        * Change the WASM runner.

*   `CHANGELOG.md`:
    *   **Purpose:**  Documents the project's version history, including new features, bug fixes, and changes.

        *   Add new bin targets
        *   Change the `default-run`

*   `GHOST_COMMUNICATION.md`:
    *   **Purpose:**  A design document outlining the vision, goals, technical implementation, and future plans for the ghost communication system.
    *   **Interactions:**  This is a design document, so it doesn't directly interact with code.  It *guides* the implementation of the ghost communication system.
    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Highly relevant if the feature involves:
        *   Adding new ways for the player to communicate with the ghost.
        *   Changing how the ghost responds to player input.
        *   Implementing a more sophisticated ghost AI or mood system.
        *   Adding voice acting or other audio enhancements to ghost communication.
    *   **Key Takeaways from this Document:** This is a critical document. It describes a data-driven, emergent communication system using:
        *   **FastText Embeddings:** For semantic understanding of player phrases and ghost moods.
        *   **Hierarchical Tagging:** For categorizing phrases and triggering responses.
        *   **Ghost Mood Model:** A dynamic emotional state for the ghost that influences its behavior.
        *   **Response Templates:**  YAML-based templates for generating ghost responses.

*   `NOTES.md`:
    *   **Purpose:**  A scratchpad for notes, ideas, research, and TODOs.

    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Would be updated to document any new major features, changes to build instructions, or updates to community links.

*   `build.rs`:
    *   **Purpose:**  A build script that runs before the main project is compiled.  Its primary purpose is to generate `*.assetidx` files, which list the assets in specific folders. This is critical for WASM builds, where directly listing directory contents is not possible.
    *   **Interactions:**  Executed by Cargo during the build process.  Reads the contents of the `assets/` directory. Writes `*.assetidx` files.
    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Would be touched if:
        *   The structure of the `assets/` folder changes significantly (e.g., new asset types are added, or folders are reorganized).
        *   The logic for generating asset lists needs to be modified.
        * We add a new directory to `get_asset_types`.

*   `clippy.toml`:
    *   **Purpose:** Configuration file for Clippy, a Rust linter that helps enforce code style and catch common mistakes.
    *   **Interactions:**  Read by Clippy during code analysis.
    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Might be touched to adjust linting rules or disable specific warnings.

*   `index.html`:

        *   The WASM loading process needs to be changed.
        *   The HTML structure needs to be modified (e.g., to add UI elements or change the canvas size).
        *   You wanted to add external Javascript libraries

*   `pkg/.gitignore`:
    *   **Purpose:**  Specifies files and folders within the `pkg/` directory that should be ignored by Git. This is typically used to exclude generated files from the WASM build.
    *   **Interactions:**  Used by Git.
    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Likely not relevant unless the WASM build process changes significantly.

*   `catall.sh`:
    * **Purpose:** A simple shell script that's likely a convenience script to list every file on the project. It doesn't have an impact on the builds, it's just for visualization purposes.
    * **Interactions:** Executed manually as a shell script by the user.
    * **Feature X Relevance:** Very little impact, unless we decide to add a new file and want to make it appear, but the script is so simple that this action is not even needed.

* `unhaunter/src/bin/unhaunter.rs`
    *   **Purpose:**  This is the main entry point for the *native* (non-WASM) build of the game. It's a very small file that simply calls `app_run()`.
    *   **Interactions:**  Executed by Cargo when running the game natively.
    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Very unlikely to be touched, unless you need to change how the application is initialized.

* `unhaunter/src/lib.rs`
    *   **Purpose:**  The main library file for the `unhaunter` crate. This file declares the `app_run` function, which is used by both the native and WASM entry points. It also contains the `wasm_load` function, which is the entry point for WASM builds.
    *   **Interactions:**  Linked into both the native and WASM builds.
    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Might be touched if you need to change how the WASM version is initialized.

* `unhaunter/src/app.rs`:
     * **Purpose**: Sets up the main Bevy application, including window settings, resources, plugins, and core systems.
     * **Interactions:**
        *   Initializes Bevy's default plugins and configures the window.
        *   Adds various custom plugins that define the game's functionality.
        *   Registers resource (`CurrentDifficulty`, `ObjectInteractionConfig`, ...).
     * **Feature X Relevance**:  This file is the heart of the application setup.  It would likely be touched if:
        *   A new plugin needs to be added to the game.
        *   A new global resource needed to be initialized.
        *   The basic application setup (window, frame rate, etc.) needs to be changed.

* `unhaunter/src/report_timer.rs`
    *   **Purpose:** Implements a system for reporting performance metrics (frame times) to the console.  Used for debugging and profiling.
    *   **Interactions:**  Uses Bevy's `DiagnosticsStore` to access performance data.
    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Could be modified to:

**Crate Structure**

The `unhaunter` project is organized into a workspace with multiple crates (sub-projects).  This is a good practice for larger projects as it promotes modularity, code reuse, and faster compilation.

Here's a breakdown of each crate and its responsibilities:

*   `uncore/`:  Contains core game logic, data structures, and systems that are shared across multiple parts of the game.  This includes:
    *   Components (data attached to entities).
    *   Resources (global data accessible throughout the game).
    *   Events (for communication between systems).
    *   Systems (the logic that operates on components and resources).
    *   Types (custom data types).
    *   Traits (shared behavior).
    *   Utilities (helper functions).
    *   Asset loading.

*   `unfog/`: Handles the miasma (fog) effect, including its visual representation, movement, and interaction with the environment.

*   `ungame/`: Contains game-specific logic that's not part of the core engine, such as:
    *   UI setup for the main game screen.
    *   Object charge management.
    *   Room change events.
    *   Gear and pause UI.

**Crate-Specific File Descriptions**

Detailed breakdown of each file per crate:

**`uncore/`**

This crate contains the basics and it is meant for most other crates to depend on it, while having minimal dependencies.

All structs/events/components/etc that need to be accessed by multiple crates should go here, unless they require
dependencies, then they would go in the `unstd` crate.

*   `uncore/src/lib.rs`: The main library file for the `uncore` crate. Defines constants, re-exports modules, and contains helper functions.
    * **Purpose:** This crate serves as the engine for the game.
    * **Interactions:** The "glue" for all of `uncore`.
    * **Feature X Relevance:** This is the lowest dependency in the project. If there is a feature that should be used in several parts of the game, the core should be touched. For example, if we wanted to add a new global variable to check for an existing "CHEAT_MODE", this is a nice place.

*   `uncore/src/assets/mod.rs`, `uncore/src/assets/index.rs`, `uncore/src/assets/tmxmap.rs`, `uncore/src/assets/tsxsheet.rs`:  Handles loading of assets, particularly TMX maps and TSX tilesets.  Includes custom asset loaders for Bevy.
    *   **Purpose:**  Provides a way to load TMX and TSX files as Bevy assets, making them accessible to the rest of the game.  The `index.rs` file enables loading `assetidx` files, which is essential for WASM builds.
    *   **Interactions:**  Interacts with Bevy's asset server and asset loading system.
    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Would be touched if:

*   `uncore/src/behavior/mod.rs`, `uncore/src/behavior/component.rs`:  Defines the `Behavior` component and related data structures, which determine how objects in the game world behave.
    *   **Purpose:**  Separates an object's visual representation (sprite) from its logical behavior.  Allows for defining complex interactions and states.
    *   **Interactions:**  Used by systems that handle object interactions, collisions, lighting, and AI.  Data is loaded from Tiled map properties.
    *   **Feature X Relevance:**  Would be touched if:
        *   New types of object behavior need to be added (e.g., a new type of interactive object).
        *   Existing behavior needs to be modified (e.g., changing how doors work).
        *   New properties need to be added to objects (e.g., adding a "fragility" property to breakable objects).

*   `uncore/src/colors.rs`:  Defines constant color values used throughout the game.
    *   **Purpose:**  Provides a central location for managing colors, making it easier to maintain consistency and make global changes.
