- Is that all you've got?
- You call that a haunting? 
- We're not impressed.
- You're pathetic.
- You're weak. 
- We're not afraid of you.
- You have no power over us.
- We will defeat you.
- We will banish you.
- You will regret crossing us. 
- This ends now.
- Leave this place, or face the consequences.
- We're coming for you.
- You can't hide from us.
