Features:
  - Add Equipment description in Loadout UI on hover, also tracks the evidence
    status.
  - Rearrange key help legend to fit the key info closer to the items that the
    keys act upon.

Fixes:
  - Found and fixed the issue with bad WASM performance and stutter. It was
    related to Bevy's trace feature. It has been disabled by default. Now works
    on Firefox too.
  - Prevent the player inventory in Loadout UI to wrap (WASM)
