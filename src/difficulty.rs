//! Difficulty Module
//! -------------------
//!
//! This module defines the difficulty system for the Unhaunter game, enabling customization
//! of various gameplay parameters to provide a range of challenges for players.
//!
//! The `Difficulty` enum represents the different difficulty levels, each with a unique name
//! and associated settings.  The `DifficultyStruct` struct holds the concrete values
//! for a specific difficulty level, which are assembled using methods within the `Difficulty` enum.
//!
//! By defining these settings directly within the `Difficulty` enum, you can fine-tune
//! the game experience for each difficulty level, providing a tailored challenge for players.
