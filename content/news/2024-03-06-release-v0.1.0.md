This [initial commit](https://github.com/deavid/unhaunter/commit/ce61e482b9eca14c1379f78941a515562986a94f)
represents the initial work done in 2022 and 2023 to get the game ready for publishing.

The game most likely started to get designed in documents in April 2022, and the first commits likely were in 2022-07-31.

From there, a long work was done to get the game ready for the first public release, adding
license, and making it presentable. 

The first release date is uncertain, but most likely on 2023-12-12. Part of the reason is that v0.1.0 is the default version for a `cargo new` package.

The game was most likely unplayable in this state. All it could do is move around in the 
map, and the map did not use Tiled at this stage. The assets were majorly temporary. They
got changed shortly after in the v0.1.1 release.
