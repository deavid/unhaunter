Frazno did not have almost any prior knowledge of the game and it shows, he started very slowly and
took his time to get onto the game.

We didn't get a chance to see all the gear and evidences available, but I think it's a very clear
demonstration on how new players approach the game, and gives very useful information on what needs
more care.
