So in the end I got 3 people that tried Unhaunter. Thanks a lot for the valuable feedback! But I realize that I missed completely the new player experience. Everyone ended in the tutorial, and stopped there in their first attempt. Seems that a lot of them got the impression that the game was the tutorial. And this is a problem. The tutorial is very basic and shows nothing of the game.

I will be taking my time to understand how to fix this properly before releasing again. Top priority has to be making new players experience the real game in the first 5 minutes.

This screws me up so much on my priorities and will set a delay on the next release... But if I cannot get people to experience the game, it doesn't matter if there's a game or not.
