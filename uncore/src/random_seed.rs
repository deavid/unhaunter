//! # Random Seed and Fast RNG Module
//!
//! A lightweight random number generation system designed for performance and WASM compatibility.
//! This module provides utilities for generating random numbers using system time as a seed source
//! instead of relying on OS-level randomness, which is particularly useful in environments like WASM.
