FieldsBeyond streamed their first playthrough of Unhaunter, which is very useful to me to analyze how new
players approach the game. This is gold!

[Watch it on Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2428841975)

There's also an additional VOD of 30 minutes of the full playthrough if anyone is interested.

However due to the new Twitch policy of removing VODs, it might not be available for long.
