//! ## Difficulty Module
//!
//! This module defines the difficulty system for the Unhaunter game, enabling
//! customization of various gameplay parameters to provide a range of challenges
//! for players.
//!
//! The `Difficulty` enum represents the different difficulty levels, each with a
//! unique name and associated settings.  The `DifficultyStruct` struct holds the
//! concrete values for a specific difficulty level, which are assembled using
//! methods within the `Difficulty` enum.
//!
//! By defining these settings directly within the `Difficulty` enum, you can
//! fine-tune the game experience for each difficulty level, providing a tailored
//! challenge for players.
